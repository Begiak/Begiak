# About me

For 15 years I have been working with data (create grids for collection, analysis and retransfusion) i'am sociologue of urban (long-range planner and consultation). 
Gradually I started to draw my results with qgis. 
Today I would like to expand my possibilities of analysis and expression of results (more than excel and the basics of qgis ðŸ˜‚) and orient myself professionally towards the "big data".
So, Iâ€™m learning Python (really), and Iâ€™m follow some people here. I hope to help them with something, but above all learn from the world of code... and its use
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to learn the tips and tricks of the codes (those who are not in the trainings), and found some data (I have already found some hereðŸ¤—)
